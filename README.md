# Test-Stand
This propulsion test stand is designed for precise testing, featuring multiple components to accommodate a load cell, securely support the motor containing fuel, and ensure proper alignment for different motor sizes. It includes screws for fixation, ensuring stability and accuracy during testing.
If you need the CAD file in any format, feel free to message me directly! I'm happy to share and discuss the design.
